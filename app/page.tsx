          Team-oriented problem-solver with a new found love for coding. Since
          completing the Northcoders software development bootcamp, Iâ€™ve found
          that I love how programming allows me to challenge myself and find new
          ways of approaching tasks. Changing careers from teaching to software
          development is a big jump, but it allows me to bring many skills I
          developed as a teacher to coding, such as communicating clearly and
          effectively, being reflective and building relationships.
