        Team-oriented problem-solver with a new found love for coding. Since
        completing the Northcoders software development bootcamp, Iâ€™ve found
        that I love how programming allows me to challenge myself and find new
        ways of approaching tasks. Changing careers from teaching to software
        development is a big jump, but it allows me to bring many skills I
        developed as a teacher to coding, such as communicating clearly and
        effectively, being reflective and building relationships.
