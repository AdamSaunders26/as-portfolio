# **Portfolio Website**

Hosted version of the website - https://www.adam-saunders.dev/

## **Project Summary**

This is my portfolio website made using TypeScript and React through Next.js, and styled with Tailwind.css. I've tried to use libraries and packages as little as possible, as I wanted to fully understand the components I was creating. The few packages I have used include SendGrid and Axios for my contact form - everything else was made by myself.

Although I'm happy with the current state of the site I know there are more areas that can be improved and please let me know if you spot any issues or bugs.
